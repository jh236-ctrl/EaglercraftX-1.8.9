Note: The following works for Chromebooks. It's probably a similar process on Linux and Macbooks. If you want to download a version that would be offline into your ChromeBook, go to the file page of 1.8. After that, press download, and it would take you to a page full of raw code. Do "ctrl s" to download into your files, and everytime you want to visit the download, go to the download open your file and double click that download.
